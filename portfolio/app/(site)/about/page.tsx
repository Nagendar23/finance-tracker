      <p>
        Iâ€™m {siteConfig.name}, a {siteConfig.role} based in {siteConfig.location}. I enjoy
        building responsive, accessible interfaces in React and Next.js and care about
        performance and clean design.
      </p>

        Outside of work, I tinker with side projects and keep learning modern web
        tooling.
